# Contact Forms With C# 9 and ASP.NET 5

## Summary

The sample contained within this repository explores what its like to build a contact form utilizing out-of-the-box features of ASP.NET Core 5 and C# 9.

- ASP.NET Model-View-Controller (MVC)
- DataAnnotations and Validation
- `record` types and `init` properties.
- Razor Pages and `BindPropertyAttribute`
- ASP.NET Tag Helpers (`asp-for`, `asp-page`, etc.)
- Dependency Injection 
- Pattern Matching
- `TempDataAttribute` on properties.

There are concepts utilized in this repo that should ease folks into building ASP.NET apps.

## My Thoughts

The contact form is one of the most common web components found on millions of websites across the internet. I've personally built 100's of these forms, but have yet to do so with the latest in ASP.NET Core 5 and C# 9 features. I set out to do so and see what kinds of previous issues have been conquered, and what new challenges lay ahead for newcomers.

I'd love to hear your thoughts, and if you think it could be even more C#-9-ified, please don't hesitate to send in a pull request.
